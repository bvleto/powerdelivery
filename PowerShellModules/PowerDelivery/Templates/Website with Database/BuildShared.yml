# MSBuild: Put entries in here for MSBuild projects containing
# code to compile. To use web deploy, your web project(s) 
# must be configured to create a web deployment package 
# (.zip file) so the path to it can be referenced in the 
# WebDeploy section
#
# MSBuild:
#   MyWebSite:
#     ProjectFile: MyWebSite.sln
#     Properties: 
#       DeployOnBuild: true
#       PublishProfile: Default

# Assets: Put entries in here for files that are needed 
# for deployment. Anything in your source or that you 
# compile needed for deployment must be referenced here.

# Assets:
#   WebSite:
#     Path: MyWebSite\DeploymentPackage\MyWebSite.zip
#     Destination: WebSites\MyProject
#   AcceptanceTests:

# WebDeploy: Put entries in here for web sites to deploy. 
# You can deploy the same website to multiple computers 
# by specifying a comma-separated list of computer names 
# for the "WebComputer" setting.
#
# WebDeploy:
#   MyWebSite:
#     WebComputer: <<WebServer>>

# UnitTests: Put entries in here for any unit tests to run. 
# Unit tests will run before deployment so these can't rely 
# on deployment actions having already occurred (use 
# acceptance tests in that case).
